# Chip-8-Emulator
An emulator for the CHIP-8 System.\n
This project is an emulator for a CHIP-8, which is a virtual machine that doesn't have any underlying hardware. I built this project to learn more about emulation and to understand the logic of how computer systems work and how to program a computer system. The Chip8.cpp file has all the decoding and all the different instructions for the CHIP-8. The Platform.cpp file simply uses the SDL graphics library to create a UI for the emulator, and the main.cpp file starts the program.
